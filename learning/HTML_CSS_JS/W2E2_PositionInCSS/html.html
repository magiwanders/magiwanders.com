POSITIONINGS:

static
relative-type: relative(to its original position), absolute(to page), fixed(to viewport), sticky (has proprieties relative to scroll)


nb. span is like a div but inline.
nb. relative with no offset is like static
nb. absolute with respect to the first parent element.
nb. the main difference between relative and absolute is that relative still occupies space on the html flow. Absolute soes not.
display: flex;
reccomended option!

<h1>CSS positioning example</h1>

<div id = "main-container">
  <div id = "static">
    I am a <span>static</span> element. I follow the normal flow.
  </div>

  <div id = "relative">
    I am a <span>relative</span> element. I can be offset by my normal position. Properties are top, bottom, right, left.
  </div>

   <div id = "relative-bis">
    I am a <span>relative</span> element. I can be offset by my normal position. Properties are top, bottom, right, left. IF I AM NOT OFFSET I BEHAVE LIKE STATIC!

     <div id = "absolute">
    I am a <span>absolute</span> element. I am out of the flow, so I dont count for spacing, and I am absolute with respect to my first parent with any positioning other than static (grey).
  </div>

  </div>

  <div id = "absolute-bis">
     I am a <span>absolute</span> element. My parent must be reative in order to stay inside it.
  </div>

  <div id = "fixed">
    I am a <span>fixed</span> element. I am fixed with the respect to scrolling and offset with respect to the viewport of the browser. If the container (putple) gets transformed it behaves like a relative.
  </div>

  <div id = "sticky">
    I am a <span>sticky</span> element. I am relative until i would disappear from viewport. Instead I stick to the specified offset
  </div>
</div>
</body>
